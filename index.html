      <h2>The Start</h2>
      <p>
        Human 'start' 7 million years ago when we splited from are common ancestor (chimpanzees) it became Sahelanthropus tchadensis gone extinct but it stared it all and because of over time we got over 20 hominins (Human species). 
        Most gone extinct but some became us or homo sapiens. all hominins had phyical and behavioral traits to to the modern humam like small teeth large bains compered to the body and walking on 2 legs, (bipedality) creativety and tool use.
      </p>

      <p>
        We humam spilted humam evolution is to 3 stages. Early hominins 7-4.4 million years ago, Australopithecines 4.4-1.4 million years ago and homo genus.
         Early hominins were liveing in africa were simialr with common ancestor because they were first common sense that why they looked ape-like such as small skull capacity. However some early hominins resembled humans like small canine (the pointy teeth you have) for eating not hunting.
         Australopithecines as early hominins lived in africa and like early hominins had ape-like feature however changes in the skull leg and back was shifting us to bipedality movement.
      </p>

      <p>
        The third and current stage of humam evolution involves the homo genus but compered to the other stages having a mix of human and ape phyical feature the early homo genus like home neanderthalensis were more simialr to current homo genus (homo sapiens) or human.In homo genus stage skull capacity stared incrising at fast path. Therefor they got sophisticated stone tool tech. they got controled of fire. all this sum up to be the first hominins to spred arouned the world. and now we homo sapiens will soon go outside of the plant eath.

      <h2>The Start of Civilization and the End</h2>

      <p>
        Civilization is a complex way of life The earliest civilizations developed between 4000 and 3000 B.E.C having economy power and It started with agricultural (farming). oh there is iron.
         approximately 10,000 years ago humam start growing food and domesitating animals. By making some sort of agricultural, families and large groups were able to live in a communities that maked the nomadic life style less relevant.
         and 5000 years later (3500 B.C.E) better farming was invented in between these two rivers, (meso) More food, and more people that buy the food, and now  they need people to help make the food. now there is so much people that buy food they need to keep track of the sales. more housing for more people (writing). people make more things, more people, law, power. 
         Society!

      <p>
        'are you tired of using lame, sad metal? introdusing BRONZE!'bill wurtz quotes? (sorry, but I had to do this) How in is bronze made from tin and copper but I don't know where tin come from there is to much arguing about it.
